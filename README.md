# Dice-Web-Based-Application:

<p style="font-size:1.2rem">The app is simply two dices that with every click on the refresh button in the app will give a new throw of the two dices for two players, and tell the winner in each stage.
</p>

> <h3><em>First, Designed a good UI for the application with CSS.<br> Then, added the javascript code that selects the two dice images and render for each refresh two random dice images.<br> Accoding to the dice values in the images, we announce the winner.</em></h3>
